# About this Repo

This repo contains another Docker image for the PHP general-purpose scripting language.

It is based on CentOS Linux and contains the Oracle `oci8` and the
`Xdebug`\*) modules. For PDF support PDFlib's proprietary `PDFlib`\*) module is
included.

# What is PHP

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development.
Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."

What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was.

PHP has useful text processing features, which includes the Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE), and many extensions and tools to parse and access XML documents. PHP standardizes all of the XML extensions on the solid base of libxml2, and extends the feature set adding SimpleXML, XMLReader and XMLWriter support.

# How to use this image

This image contains the major database modules, the PDFlib module and the Xdebug module.

## Start a PHP Apache default instance

    docker run --name www-default -d astrobl1904/php-dev
    
This image includes `EXPOSE 80` (the default HTTP port)

## Start a PHP FastCGI container

    docker run --name php-fpm-backend -d astrobl1904/php-dev:5.6-fpm-centos
    
This image includes `EXPOSE 9000`. If linked to a web server container make sure both container use the same documents root.

# How to extend this image

If you want to create a certain Apache vhost, you may do so with providing an argument to the httpd command. This creates a `DocumentRoot` under `/var/www/` with the provided servername. You can either mount a local directory into this mount point or mount a volume from another Docker container. After the FQDN you can provide additional key-value pairs that will be substituted in the vhost template (in case you mounted your own template).  
_See [Managing data in containers](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#volume)._

    docker run -name www-myserver -v /your/document/root:/var/www/myserver.domain.tld -d astrobl1904/php-dev httpd myserver.domain.tld [[key=value] [key2=value]...]

# Supported Docker versions

This image is supported on Docker version 1.6.2.

Support for older versions (down to 1.0) is provided on a best-effort basis.
